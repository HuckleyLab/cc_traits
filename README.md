**Question**: Can nonlinear methods improve the predictive value of species' traits with regard to climate-driven range shifts?

## Abstract

Accurately predicting species’ range shifts in response to environmental change is a central ecological objective and applied imperative. Species’ functional traits are powerful predictors of responses in detailed studies and have thus been extensively incorporated in predictive frameworks such as vulnerability analyses.  In synthetic analyses, traits emerge as significant but weak predictors of species’ range shifts across recent climate change. These studies assume linearity in the relationship between a trait and its function, while detailed empirical work often reveals unimodal relationships, thresholds, and other nonlinearities in many trait-function relationships. We hypothesize that the use of linear modeling approaches fails to capture these nonlinearities and therefore may be under-powering traits to predict range shifts. We evaluate the predictive performance of four different machine learning approaches that can capture nonlinear relationships (ridge-regularized linear regression, ridge-regularized kernel regression, support vector regression, and random forests). We validate our models using four multi-decadal range shift datasets in montane plants, montane small mammals, and marine fish. We show that nonlinear approaches perform substantially better than least-squares linear modeling in reproducing historical range shifts. In addition, using novel model observation and interrogation techniques, we identify trait classes (e.g. dispersal- or diet-related traits) that are primary drivers of model predictions, which is consistent with expectation. However, disagreements among models in the directionality of trait predictors suggests limits to trait-based statistical predictive frameworks. Our results highlight that non-linear approaches promise substantially improved, but potentially still limited, capacity to leverage species traits to predict climate change responses in contexts such as species vulnerability analyses.
