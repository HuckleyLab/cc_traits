    "# Traits and Range Shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "We are attempting to understand the type and magnitude of the effects that various physiological or behavioral traits have had on historical range shifts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that standard linear regression has been only able to explain a small percentage of the variance seen in range shift data for several taxa ([Angert et al., 2011](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01620.x/abstract)). This is likely as a result of the relationships between predictor and response variables being something other than linear, especially since several variables have biological relevance for their ability to facilitate range shifts. \n",
